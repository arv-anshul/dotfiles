<summary>ðŸ˜± Important Note Before Installation</summary>

> ðŸ“‹ Copied from [**@CoreyMSchafer/dotfiles**](https://github.com/CoreyMSchafer/dotfiles/blob/17dff1bbd8d6e4909800e163c16f6991f9fcc68d/README.md?plain=1#L17-L31)

The configurations and scripts in this repository are **HIGHLY PERSONALIZED** to my own preferences and workflows. If you decide to use them, please be aware that they will **MODIFY** your current system, potentially making some changes that are **IRREVERSIBLE** without a fresh installation of your operating system.

Furthermore, while I strive to backup files wherever possible, I cannot guarantee that all files are backed up. The backup mechanism is designed to backup SOME files **ONCE**. If the script is run more than once, the initial backups will be **OVERWRITTEN**, potentially resulting in loss of data. While I could implement timestamped backups to preserve multiple versions, this setup is optimized for my personal use, and a single backup suffices for me.

If you would like a development environment similar to mine, I highly encourage you to fork this repository and make your own personalized changes to these scripts instead of running them exactly as I have them written for myself.

A less serious (but potentially annoying) change it will make is setting the Desktop background to the image I use in my tutorials. This is the script I use to set up machines I will be recording on, after all.

I likely won't accept pull requests unless they align closely with my personal preferences and the way I use my development environment. But if there are some obvious errors in my scripts then corrections would be welcome!

If you choose to run these scripts, please do so with **EXTREME CAUTION**. It's recommended to review the scripts and understand the changes they will make to your system before proceeding.

By using these scripts, you acknowledge and accept the risk of potential data loss or system alteration. Proceed at your own risk.
